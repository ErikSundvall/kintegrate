# Roadmap

## version 0.1 test setup
* a textarea for pasting json into and some stored instance examples (from /example/instance folder) as input
* a json treeviewer that when a node is clicked outputs JSON-path of selected node...
* ...to the cursor position in another textarea
 
## version 0.2 website version
* make a build setup that can publish the html+css.js as a testable in /demo subdirectory of /docs

## version 0.3 dynamic sources (local use)
* extra (optional) window running e.g. Better's form renderer that can populate input window after press of a button


## version 0.x
* investigate if it in addition to a web based tool can be built as a VS Code extension so that it is easy to wotk with the examples and transformation scripts as local files and version control in e.g. Git

## Possible extras
* Investigate possible usage of https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor (if a separate transform code window could be added)
